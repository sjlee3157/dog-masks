<!-- Lecture Notes:
Every HTML page needs to have 1 and only 1 body
Semantic tags: newer tags (not <div>)

MDN is the go-to resource by Mozilla.
Search MDN HTML elements reference.

<strong> and <em> are SEMANTIC - they provide a little bit of meaning, and it's OK to use them.
do not use <b> or <i>. use CSS instead.

The <header></header> and <footer></footer> tags don’t generate new sections in a document:
they divide up the content inside sections.
every sectioning element (body, article, section, nav and aside) can have its own header and footer.

Each section has its own heading hierarchy.

It’s always the first heading element (let it be h1 or a lower rank heading tag) that defines the heading of the given section. The following heading tags inside the same section need to be relative to this. (If the first heading is an h3 inside a sectioning element, don’t put an h3 after that.)

<nav></nav> and <aside></aside> don’t belong to the main outline of the HTML document
they are usually not rendered initially by assistive technologies.
