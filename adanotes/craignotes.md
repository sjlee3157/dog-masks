_The Door in the Wall_ by Marguerite de Angeli

Don't get bogged down in the details - keep moving forward!
Exposure.
Confidence.
Sustainability.
Collaboration.
What do I learn about how I work when I have to work in a pair?
  - Verbalize what I plan to do.
  - It's not "fast" in the same way (I can't look things up quickly).
  - Process > end-vision is emphasized.
  - We hold each other accountable to "good form":
      - Work methodically.
      - Scientific method to rule out what's not broken (hypothesis, fix).
      - Commit often
      - Working in a "predictable flow"
  - I verbalize my strengths and weaknesses.
      - Weaknesses:
          - logic
          - reading text
      - Strengths:
          - empathy
          - patience
          - analogy + visualization + everyday usage of abstracted processes
  - **GOAL:** Know our roles and how they meld together.

## GitLab
### Introduction to GitLab flow
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html

###
- README driven/documentation driven development - write interface for the end user
    - That is the first thing you write the tests for
    - git --help describes the command line interface
    - write tests for usage
- Chef is a DSL on top of Ruby
- Terraform (HCL)
- "glue code" (SRE/DevOps do a lot of this)
- monitoring/collecting metrics
- Query language: Grafana (paired with Prometheus - data source - Prometheus query language) (dashboard)
